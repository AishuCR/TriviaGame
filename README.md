<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>This trivia game is themed as a Jungle and some questions pop up once you start the game.

Each question gives you 15 seconds to answer. If you didn't answer the question within the given time or didn't choose the right answer it'll show you the right answer once you ran out of time. 

By the end of the game it displays the number of questions answered right and wrong and it also has a start over option.
